## DAY 1
Today I began researching on how to make RC Plane Wings. Since the plane I was building was going to be 3d printed out of LW-PLA, I wanted to also make the wings made from LW-PLA. However, there are many problems with LW-PlA, one being the stringing problem. Since LW PLA is an actively foaming filament, when we move the nozzle, even if we stop retracting, the filament keeps coming out, leadng to severe cases of stringing. Furthermore, if we tried to retract the filament back into the nozzle, it would foam up inside the nozzle, causing a clog. This means, that the 3d model itself must be designed so that there are not pauses or retractions throughout the entire print, to allow good surface finish and quality. 
One of the main problems I encountered was that there werent that many tutorials dedicated to 3d modeling for lw pla. Thankfully, Tom Stanton made a wonderful tutorial on how to make a LW-PLA wing, but this was still far behind from what I needed to accomplish.

## Day 2
Today I began following Tom Stanton's tutorial on the RC Plane Wing with LW PLA. Today I just wanted to focus on understanding what techniques he used and why, so that I can apply them to my future wing models. After closely following and modifying Tom Stanton's wing I made my first LW-PLA Wing. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f00405bd-92dd-4275-ab1e-33d69ad9d240)

The circular inner ribs you are seeing, are ways to reinforce the LW-PLA, and still be extremely light weight, as it is an RC Plane after all. The entire process involved clever tricks to make the slicer print the entire model in one go, without any retractions.

Time Spent: 4 hours

## Day 3
Today I sliced the model I designed earlier, and here was the result ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d58d99f3-8a11-4770-8cba-f3f1cd1bdc86)
As you can see, there are no retractions, and only 17 seconds of retraction, meaning the print was consistent all the way through, without any stringing. After that, I printed the model, with my 3d printer. The result was good, and was lighter and stronger than the commerical 3d print wing files I received with my plane.

Time Spent: 3 hours

## Day 4
Today I worked on designing the actual wing. This actual wing would be around 43 inches long, with 2 servo mounts, for 2 9g servos, and I wanted to design a 5 degree dihedral as well for more strength and stability

Model of the wing I wanted to design above, but its not ready to print yet. 

Time Spent: 4 hours

## Day 5
Today I worked on a portion the wing, to make it ready to print in LW PLA. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90158a64-1c84-417b-a2fb-783069694edb)

I modified it so that there would be space for another wing to slide in, and edited it for more weight performance.

Time Spent: 5 hours
