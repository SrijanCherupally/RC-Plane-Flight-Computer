## Time Spent Total - 53 hours

## DAY 1 - 6/22
Today I began researching on how to make RC Plane Wings. Since the plane I was building was going to be 3d printed out of LW-PLA, I wanted to also make the wings made from LW-PLA. However, there are many problems with LW-PlA, one being the stringing problem. Since LW PLA is an actively foaming filament, when we move the nozzle, even if we stop retracting, the filament keeps coming out, leadng to severe cases of stringing. Furthermore, if we tried to retract the filament back into the nozzle, it would foam up inside the nozzle, causing a clog. This means, that the 3d model itself must be designed so that there are not pauses or retractions throughout the entire print, to allow good surface finish and quality. 
One of the main problems I encountered was that there werent that many tutorials dedicated to 3d modeling for lw pla. Thankfully, Tom Stanton made a wonderful tutorial on how to make a LW-PLA wing, but this was still far behind from what I needed to accomplish.

Time Spent: 5 hours

## Day 2 - 6/23
Today I began following Tom Stanton's tutorial on the RC Plane Wing with LW PLA. Today I just wanted to focus on understanding what techniques he used and why, so that I can apply them to my future wing models. After closely following and modifying Tom Stanton's wing I made my first LW-PLA Wing. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f00405bd-92dd-4275-ab1e-33d69ad9d240)

The circular inner ribs you are seeing, are ways to reinforce the LW-PLA, and still be extremely light weight, as it is an RC Plane after all. The entire process involved clever tricks to make the slicer print the entire model in one go, without any retractions.

Time Spent: 4 hours

## Day 3 - 6/24
Today I sliced the model I designed earlier, and here was the result ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d58d99f3-8a11-4770-8cba-f3f1cd1bdc86)
As you can see, there are no retractions, and only 17 seconds of retraction, meaning the print was consistent all the way through, without any stringing. After that, I printed the model, with my 3d printer. The result was good, and was lighter and stronger than the commerical 3d print wing files I received with my plane.

Time Spent: 3 hours

## Day 4 - 6/26
Today I worked on designing the actual wing. This actual wing would be around 43 inches long, with 2 servo mounts, for 2 9g servos, and I wanted to design a 5 degree dihedral as well for more strength and stability

Model of the wing I wanted to design above, but its not ready to print yet. 

Time Spent: 4 hours

## Day 5 - 6/27
Today I worked on a portion the wing, to make it ready to print in LW PLA. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90158a64-1c84-417b-a2fb-783069694edb)

I modified it so that there would be space for another wing to slide in, and edited it for more weight performance.

Time Spent: 5 hours

## Day 6 - 6/28
Today I worked on another portion of the wing, the aileron part of the wing, ready to print in LW PLA. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a23b66b0-ebb1-4c55-b1a1-8e7757d5cd96)

Making this part was extremely difficult with LW-PLA, because in order to mount the servo's properly, I had to make a divet in the 3d print, but doing so lead to not having ribs. To solve this problem, I added ribs after modeling the servo holder. I also had to make some other modifications to make it work. Overall, this was extremely time consuming, and I had to do a lot of experimenting.

Time Spent: 10 hours

## Day 7 - 7/1
I also worked on the dihedral today. The dihedral would hold the wings at an angle, and make sure it wouldnt pitch too agressively. I also had to make it so that I could slide the prints in easily. That was time consuming, but I got the design right. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df982a4e-b18e-40a9-8fc6-b047a3eae455)

Time Spent: 4 hours

## Day 8 - 7/3
Since the designing was done, today I worked on the PCB that I was going to use to get the data and valuable comparisons for the plane. To do this, I wanted to have a couple things. I wanted an ESP32-S3, as they were extremely powerful, and very easy to design around (No USB to UART chip needed). I also needed an IMU for Acceleration, and a GPS for velocity and position mapping. So for today, I figured out all the components I would need to build this. 

Time Spent: 3 hours

## Day 9 - 7/5
After figuring out all the components necessary and after further research, I made the schematic. This took around 10 hours of work. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b055a51-ca96-4c06-aa51-d0f4e8735dc8)

Time Spent: 10 hours

## Day 10 - 7/6
After finishing the PCB I finished routing the entire PCB. I wouldnt have any high current loads on this board, so everything is relatively tightly packed together, and has less wide traces and vias. This is the finished product: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41a647c-585e-464d-b89e-d14d1f3b3f70)
