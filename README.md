# RC-Plane-Flight-Computer
I am making an RC Plane, and I want to test the RC Plane for multiple different characteristics, by designing and iterating on new wing designs. For this testing, I want to keep it as numerical and factual as possible, meaning I needed a quanitative way to measure and verify my findings. 
Some of the experiments I will be conducting on my RC Plane are the following: Stall tests (Figuring out how much the Plane can fly vertically up before falling down), STOL Tests (How fast and how short distances the plane needs to take off/land), Flight Endurance tests (Find how long the plane can last until 15% battery), Manueverability tests (Finding out how fast the plane can react to my controls, and how fast it can spin and roll).
In order to gain this data, I will be needing a Flight Computer for my plane, to determine the velocity, acceleration, position, and angle. To determine all of this information, I will need the following capabbilities on the PCB: 1) GPS, 2) IMU, 3) Antenna, 4) MCU. Since GPS and Antenna will be integrated together I will not need to worry about this.
